Advocating and designing for in between people, places and heterotopias: a reflection on my poster. \u201cIn challenging times and places we need togetherness more than ever. To share thoughts, ideas and inspiration. To keep MOVING. To grow together. Imagine there\u2019s no me, imagine just we. what would be possible\u201d -Forward Festival, Vienna. My fascination with socio- cultural differences stems from living in the most unequal country on earth: South Africa. In between the urban spaces that separate the pristine and fortunate to the bustling destitute; anomalies and patterns of movement between the two realities are formed. Some tangible and intangible. I am moved by hackers, survivalists, transformers and rebels who fight for democratizing access, belonging and informality. In this credence, I have been inspired to foster social impact design for migrants, movers and bodies living by the borders or at the core of the otherlyness. What disruptions can we make together to give acknowledgement and power to those functioning in heterotopias? Questioning how people and space work in the inbetween, I have been inspired by the philosophy of Michel Foucault who describes in between spaces as \u201ccertain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow \u2018other\u2019: disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming\u201d . My fight is giving voice to these emerging spaces and their inhabitants and learning from them. WEEK 1 BOOTCAMP REFLECTION Considerations and highlights from The theme of designing in first person perspective What is the first person perspective? Understanding that I am part of a socio-technological ecosystem, where the studio and the community are my context. I am part of the system I design for Designing interventions on 3rd person perspective does not allow for complexities and the reality of the users. A bottom up approach evolves constantly as more actors are introduced while engaging in first person. Goals shape your design: failing is part of the iterative process Use what is available to you, transition to make things happen and apply it locally. Make connections and a community Everything I do ( pass or fail ) creates a precedent An example of designing in first person Step 1: Analyse things, people from afar using data and predictions Step2: After cultural clashes, design from understanding people\u2019s problems and mapping what you\u2019ve learnt Step3: Make it happen, collaborate with those who are interested building an ecosystem WHO AM I? WHO DO I NEED TO BECOME? Reflections on my personal development plan After visiting the neighbourhood of Poblenou and attending the seminar on first person perspectives, I came to learn that I am part of an ecosystem with multiple traversing connections and networks. These connections meet all my present and future skills, attitudes and knowledges building my journey and professional identity With self direction, I can take charge of my own development and move towards my goals. I should be aware of my limitations and learn from my peers and surrounds My vision and current identity culminate into my personal development plan. Receiving feedback from peers and the community compares and strengthens my direction","title":"Bootcamp What is my fight"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp-what-is-my-fight","text":"WHAT IS MY FIGHT?
